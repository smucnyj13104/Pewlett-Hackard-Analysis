# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
##Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
- The purposes of this analysis were to find out how many employees of each title were retiring, and generate a list of employees eligible for a program where instead of retiring, they would work part-time as mentors.
 
##Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

- The number of retiring people were:
	- 29414	Senior Engineers
	- 28254	Senior Staff
	- 14222	Engineers
	- 12243	Staff
	- 4502 Technique Leaders
	- 1761	Assistant Engineers
	- 2 Managers
- About 1500 employees were eligible for the program. 

##Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
###How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Many roles will need to be filled. Almost 30,000 senior engineers, almost 30,000 senior staff, almost 15,000 engineers, and over 12,000 staff. 

###Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- There are probably not enough employees to mentor the next generation given the number of roles that need to be filled vs. the number of program-eligible mentors.
